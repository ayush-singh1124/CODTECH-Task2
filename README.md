Project Overview: Image Classification
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can classify images into various categories. We'll use a popular dataset, such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST, for demonstration purposes.

Steps Involved:
Dataset Selection and Preparation:

Select a suitable dataset for image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST).
Preprocess the data: normalize pixel values, one-hot encode labels, and split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Implementation:

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model on the training dataset.
Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and training/testing loss curves.
Comparison and Analysis:

Compare the performance of different model architectures or hyperparameters.
Analyze the results to determine which model performs best for the given problem.
